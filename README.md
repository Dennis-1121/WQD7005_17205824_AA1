AA1 for WQD7005 Session 2023/2024 Semester 1

This repository is created for Alternative Assessment 1 for WQD7005 Data Mining Session 2023/2024 Semester 1. This case study is related to the E-commerce Customer Behaviour Analysis using Python, Talend Data Preparation Free Desktop, Talend Open Studio for Data Integration and SAS Enterprise Miner.

Objective of this case study:
1. Aims to assess students' ability to apply decision tree and ensemble methods
2. Utilising the model to derive meaningful business insights

Tools used:
1. Python : Used to aggregate and generate the data structure required for this case study from the selected datasets.
2. Talend Data Preparation Free Desktop: Used to preprocessing and cleaning the datasets
   - Inspect the data quality of the datasets
   - Correct the data type of the datasets
   - transform the value of the datasets for consistency
   - Inspect the invalid values
   - changing the feature name
3. Talend Open Studio for Data Integration: Remove duplicates records from the datasets

Dataset 
The dataset used in this case study consists of 1021 rows with 12 features related to customer transactions. The dataset used is aggregated from the dataset obtained in Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/earthfromtop/amazon-sales-fy202021) using Python with Pandas and Numpy libraries. The original dataset consists of 35 features with 286k of entries data. To fulfill the objective of this case study, the dataset is aggregated into 1000 rows with 12 features. The 12 features are Customer ID, Age, Gender, Location, Membership Level, TotalPurchases, TotalSpent, TotalDiscount, FavoriteCategory, FavoritePaymentMethod, LastPurchaseDate, and Churn.
